#### Impact Scale (1-5)
1. **Minimal**: Negligible impact on operations
2. **Minor**: Small impact, easily manageable
3. **Moderate**: Noticeable impact requiring attention
4. **Major**: Significant impact affecting operations
5. **Severe**: Critical impact threatening organization

#### Likelihood Scale (1-5)
1. **Very Low**: Extremely unlikely to occur
2. **Low**: Unlikely but possible
3. **Medium**: Moderate chance of occurrence
4. **High**: Likely to occur
5. **Very High**: Almost certain to occur
